Description: """
The warm, inviting scent of freshly baked bread and sweet pastries fills
the air upon entering this cozy little shop. A fine dusting of flour clings
lightly to the wooden floorboards and countertops. Shelves and display cases
brim with golden-baked goodsâ€”loaves of crusty bread, delicate pastries,
and confections in all shapes and sizes. Icing glistens under soft lighting,
while nuts, berries, and chocolate chips adorn many of the treats with artistic
precision. At the back of the shop, an antique wooden cash register rests
atop a counter, its brass details dulled slightly with age and use.
